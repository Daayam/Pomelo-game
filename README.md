## What's the point
The goal of this project has been to create a text-based game to experiment with and apply the concept of objects and classes. Another goal was to start using Github, and to build a portfolio of projects.

## General Info
This is a turn based dueling game with a magical theme. The game is entirely text based and can be played directly from the terminal window. Players start the game by making their own character and choosing a wand. The player then learns spells and duels with a non playable character (npc). The first character to lose all their health loses the duel. 

### Features
- The game is customizable. Players can choose their own unique character, and a personalized wand.
- Your choices have an impact and will change the way you play.
- The game is magically themed with wands, spells and potions.

### Launch

The game can be launched directly from the terminal window. 

### Technology

## Additional Info

### Inspiration

This game is inspired by the world of Harry Potter, and based on a Codecademy online course.

### Disclaimer
This is a game for personal use only. The purpose of uploading to Github is to build a portfolio, and also so that others can learn about how object oriented programming might be used to make a game.
